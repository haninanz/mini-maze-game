# Mini Maze Game
Basically a Find-the-Food game. More details TBA when I have the time and not too lazy to do that.

### To-Do List
1. Obstacles for now are simply cosmetic, not yet functional.
2. Implement level system: if the player finds the food, they will level up. Each level up will grant one additional obstacles.
3. How to fix the "blinking"...?
